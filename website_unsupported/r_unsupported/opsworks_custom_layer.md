Provides an OpsWorks custom layer resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_opsworks_custom_layer" "custlayer" {
  name       = "My Awesome Custom Layer"
  short_name = "awesome"
  stack_id   = aws_opsworks_stack.main.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A human-readable name for the layer.
* `short_name` - (Required) A short, machine-readable name for the layer, which will be used to identify it in the Chef node JSON.
* `stack_id` - (Required) The id of the stack the layer will belong to.
* `auto_assign_elastic_ips` - (Optional) Whether to automatically assign an elastic IP address to the layer's instances.
* `auto_assign_public_ips` - (Optional) For stacks belonging to a VPC, whether to automatically assign a public IP address to each of the layer's instances.
* `cloudwatch_configuration` - (Optional) Will create an EBS volume and connect it to the layer's instances. See [Cloudwatch Configuration](#cloudwatch-configuration).
* `custom_instance_profile_arn` - (Optional) The ARN of an IAM profile that will be used for the layer's instances.
* `custom_security_group_ids` - (Optional) Ids for a set of security groups to apply to the layer's instances.
* `auto_healing` - (Optional) Whether to enable auto-healing for the layer.
* `install_updates_on_boot` - (Optional) Whether to install OS and package updates on each instance when it boots.
* `instance_shutdown_timeout` - (Optional) The time, in seconds, that OpsWorks will wait for Chef to complete after triggering the Shutdown event.
* `elastic_load_balancer` - (Optional) Name of an Elastic Load Balancer to attach to this layer
* `drain_elb_on_shutdown` - (Optional) Whether to enable Elastic Load Balancing connection draining.
* `system_packages` - (Optional) Names of a set of system packages to install on the layer's instances.
* `use_ebs_optimized_instances` - (Optional) Whether to use EBS-optimized instances.
* `ebs_volume` - (Optional) Will create an EBS volume and connect it to the layer's instances. See [EBS Volume](#ebs-volume).
* `custom_json` - (Optional) Custom JSON attributes to apply to the layer.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

The following extra optional arguments, all lists of Chef recipe names, allow
custom Chef recipes to be applied to layer instances at the five different
lifecycle events, if custom cookbooks are enabled on the layer's stack:

* `custom_configure_recipes`
* `custom_deploy_recipes`
* `custom_setup_recipes`
* `custom_shutdown_recipes`
* `custom_undeploy_recipes`

### EBS Volume

* `mount_point` - (Required) The path to mount the EBS volume on the layer's instances.
* `size` - (Required) The size of the volume in gigabytes.
* `number_of_disks` - (Required) The number of disks to use for the EBS volume.
* `raid_level` - (Required) The RAID level to use for the volume.
* `type` - (Optional) The type of volume to create. This may be `standard` (the default), `io1` or `gp2`.
* `iops` - (Optional) For PIOPS volumes, the IOPS per disk.
* `encrypted` - (Optional) Encrypt the volume.

### Cloudwatch Configuration

* `enabled` - (Optional)
* `log_streams` - (Optional) A block the specifies how an opsworks logs look like. See [Log Streams](#log-streams).

* `buffer_duration` - (Optional) Specifies the time duration for the batching of log events. The minimum value is `5000` and default value is `5000`.
